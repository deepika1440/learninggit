Got it 👍 You added the “Enable Expand All functionality” option in the Unity Accordion dialog as per new requirements.
Here are some points you can put in your documentation about why it was added:

Purpose of “Enable Expand All Functionality”
Improved User Experience

Allows users to expand all accordion panels at once instead of opening them one by one.

Useful when users want to quickly scan all available content without multiple clicks.

Accessibility (ADA/WCAG Compliance)

Reduces cognitive load for screen reader users who would otherwise need to navigate each accordion individually.

Provides an inclusive way to consume large sets of content efficiently.

Business Requirement Alignment

Stakeholders requested the option to display all content at once for scenarios like FAQs, product comparisons, and detailed guides.

Supports both use cases: compact view (default accordion) and full expanded view (when enabled).

Flexibility for Authors

Content authors can choose whether the accordion behaves traditionally (one section at a time) or provides an “expand all” mode.

No need for custom code or additional components—controlled directly via dialog configuration.

Consistency Across Components

Matches functionality already present in similar UI patterns (e.g., tab groups, collapsible sections).

Ensures consistent interaction patterns across the site.

👉 You can phrase it in your document as:

“The ‘Enable Expand All functionality’ option was introduced to improve usability, accessibility, and flexibility. It allows users to expand all accordion sections simultaneously, supporting ADA compliance, business use cases like FAQs, and giving authors better control over content presentation.”

Do you also want me to draft a short version (2–3 lines) for release notes, and a detailed version for technical documentation?

Perfect question 👍
If you made CSS and JavaScript changes to support this new “Enable Expand All functionality” in the accordion, you can document it like this:

CSS Changes
Added/Updated Classes

Introduced new CSS class (e.g., .accordion-expand-all) to handle styling when all panels are expanded.

Ensured proper spacing, borders, and alignment when multiple sections are open simultaneously.

State Handling

Updated styles for expanded vs collapsed state to ensure consistent visual feedback.

Added transitions/animations for smoother expand/collapse interactions.

Accessibility Styles

Focus styles updated to maintain visible keyboard focus when multiple sections are expanded.

Adjusted responsive behavior so that expanded content is readable on mobile view.

JavaScript Changes
Expand/Collapse Logic

Implemented a function to toggle all panels open/close when “Enable Expand All” is selected.

Ensured compatibility with existing single-panel expand behavior.

Event Handling

Added new event listener for the “Expand All” option.

Updated individual panel toggle logic to avoid conflicts with the “expand all” state.

Accessibility Enhancements

Managed ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls) dynamically for each panel to meet WCAG standards.

Ensured screen readers correctly announce the state (expanded/collapsed) of panels.

Performance Optimization

Applied minimal DOM updates when toggling all panels to avoid reflow/repaint issues.

Reused existing accordion functions wherever possible to reduce redundant code.
