You want Grid Count points similar to the structure we used earlier (UX, accessibility, business, authoring, consistency) + CSS-related points. Here’s a clean set for your documentation:

Grid Count Points
Improved User Experience – Allows responsive layout adjustment, ensuring content is displayed neatly across devices.

Accessibility – Supports predictable grid structures, making it easier for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

Business Requirements Alignment – Meets design standards and branding needs by enforcing consistent grid-based layouts.

Flexibility for Authors – Provides authors the ability to select grid count (e.g., 10, 12), giving more control over content structure.

Consistency Across Components – Ensures a uniform design system by applying the same grid logic across different components.

CSS Points
Added Classes – Introduced specific grid utility classes for layout control (e.g., grid-column-span, uc-masthead-content-block).

State Handling – CSS handles variations like single-column, two-column, and alignment states (left, right).

Accessibility Styles – Grid-based spacing and alignment styles improve readability and interaction without breaking accessibility standards.

Responsive Behavior – Media queries and mixins ensure the grid adapts seamlessly across screen sizes.

Maintainable Styling – Centralized grid rules reduce duplication and keep styling consistent across components
