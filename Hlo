✅ 1. Overview
The Product Card Masthead v1 component:

Is a reusable AEM component designed for displaying credit card product offers.

Offers a modular structure using subcomponents from the atom/component library.

Subcomponents used:

Sections (as per the document):

Top Bar/Tagline (Offer)

Headline/Title + CTA (e.g., Apply Now)

✅ 2. UI Requirement and Behavior
ID	Element	UI Behavior
1	Background Component (Top)	Left side of the masthead uses grey background (Color: Grey) with container padding and visual separation.

6	Apply Now Button	Pulled from Apply Now field in XF. Supports override via author dialog.
7	Terms & Conditions	Dynamically pulled via existing backend logic. Displayed as a link or modal trigger.
✅ 3. Typography
The document doesn’t list font specifics, but based on Bank of America’s design system, the standard typography would include:

Card Name / Title – Bold or semi-bold, approx. 16–18px.

CTA (Apply Now) – Button-styled text, bold, typically 14–16px.

Terms & Conditions – Smallest font, regular weight, underlined or linked.

Buttons: Styled using Button v1 atom — standard BoA CTA styles.

Modals: Triggered via “T” icon for terms — implemented using Unity Modal Component.
