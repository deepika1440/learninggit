Got it üëç You want to prepare documentation points for your AEM change (hide top & bottom border for Accordion component), including functional/business points and CSS points. Here‚Äôs a clean draft you can use:

üìë Documentation ‚Äì Hide Border Top & Bottom for Accordion Component
Functional / Business Justification
Improved User Experience

Provides a cleaner design option by removing unnecessary borders, especially in scenarios where multiple accordions are stacked together.

Reduces visual clutter, improving readability.

Accessibility

Ensures border removal does not interfere with focus states or screen reader experience.

Maintains WCAG 2.2 AA compliance by handling visual focus and spacing correctly.

Business Requirement Alignment

Meets design specifications requested by business stakeholders for a modern, minimal UI.

Provides brand consistency with digital style guides.

Flexibility for Authors

Authors can enable/disable top and bottom borders through a simple dialog checkbox (hideBorderTopBottom) without code changes.

Allows use of a single Accordion component for multiple layout requirements.

Consistency Across Components

Implements border handling in line with other components that offer border visibility options.

Establishes reusable styling patterns across the site.

CSS / Technical Implementation Points
Added / Updated Classes

Introduced accordion--no-border (or similar) class applied when hideBorderTopBottom is checked.

Updated SCSS/CSS rules to apply conditional border removal.

.accordion--no-border {
  border-top: none;
}
.accordion--no-border:last-child {
  border-bottom: none;
}
State Handling

Conditional data-sly-test ensures class is only applied when author selects the checkbox.

Does not impact default accordion behavior when the option is not selected.

Accessibility Styles

Borders removed without affecting focus outlines or hover states.

Retains padding and spacing so that visual grouping remains clear even without borders.

üëâ This way, your doc shows why the change was made (business + UX) and how it was implemented (CSS + state handling).

Do you want me to also draft this in a confluence-style format (with headings + tables) so you can directly paste into your project docs?
