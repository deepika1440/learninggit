Got it 👍. Based on the mobile flip stacking order you showed in the dialog XML, here are the points you can use:

📱 Functional / Business Points
Improved User Experience – On mobile, users can view the text before or after the image depending on readability and content importance.

Accessibility – Logical stacking order ensures screen readers follow the correct reading flow (image → text or text → image).

Business Requirement Alignment – Supports marketing or compliance needs where content hierarchy must change for smaller devices.

Flexibility for Authors – Authors can toggle the stacking order without code changes.

Consistency Across Components – The option ensures uniform behavior across all components that use images + text blocks.

🎨 CSS / Frontend Implementation Points
Added Updated Classes – Example: .flip-order or .stack-text-top applied conditionally based on the toggle.

State Handling – Use modifiers (.is-flipped, .default-order) to switch between stacking modes.

Accessibility Styles – Maintain proper contrast, spacing, and avoid content overlap when order changes.

Responsive Media Queries – Apply flex-direction: column-reverse; (or grid order) only for mobile breakpoints.

Fallback Handling – Ensure that even without JS/CSS, the default stacking order is preserved logically.
