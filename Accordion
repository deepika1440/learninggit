Got it üëç You added the ‚ÄúEnable Expand All functionality‚Äù option in the Unity Accordion dialog as per new requirements.
Here are some points you can put in your documentation about why it was added:

Purpose of ‚ÄúEnable Expand All Functionality‚Äù
Improved User Experience

Allows users to expand all accordion panels at once instead of opening them one by one.

Useful when users want to quickly scan all available content without multiple clicks.

Accessibility (ADA/WCAG Compliance)

Reduces cognitive load for screen reader users who would otherwise need to navigate each accordion individually.

Provides an inclusive way to consume large sets of content efficiently.

Business Requirement Alignment

Stakeholders requested the option to display all content at once for scenarios like FAQs, product comparisons, and detailed guides.

Supports both use cases: compact view (default accordion) and full expanded view (when enabled).

Flexibility for Authors

Content authors can choose whether the accordion behaves traditionally (one section at a time) or provides an ‚Äúexpand all‚Äù mode.

No need for custom code or additional components‚Äîcontrolled directly via dialog configuration.

Consistency Across Components

Matches functionality already present in similar UI patterns (e.g., tab groups, collapsible sections).

Ensures consistent interaction patterns across the site.
